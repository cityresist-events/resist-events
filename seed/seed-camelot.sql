  Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
  We built <strong>Camelot Resist Events</strong> because there are many organizations throughout the realm that hold events, rallies, quests, and peasant uprisings. Finding these events can be challenging — each organization uses different communication channels, from carrier pigeons to town criers to enchanted scrolls.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 16px; line-height: 1.7;">
  Our goal is to create a single, unified event calendar for the community. We want to make civic engagement as easy as possible by removing barriers to finding out what''s happening and when.
</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
  This project is <strong>open source</strong> and community-driven. If your organization would like to participate, hit the <em>Contact Us</em> button to get started. You don''t have to be oppressed to join — but it helps.
